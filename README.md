## Getting Started

### Accessing the CIBR Cluster (MAC)

Open a terminal window on your laptop/computer and using your assigned student# account (the example below assumes that your assigned student # is 14) and eight character password enter the following:
```
ssh student14@sphere.grid.bcm.edu
```
and enter the password when prompted.

```
student14@sphere.grid.bcm.edu's password: 
```
Run the command hard-reset to do the account set up for this class. Among other things, this will provide an initial set of files and directories. NOTE: you will need to put in the full path to the /home/student20/bin/ location for this file. So run it like this:

Log out using the exit command and then log back in. This allows the changes you made above to take effect. 

You should be able to run jupyter now by typing the start-jupyter command. 
```
start-jupyter
```
Run the command check-jupyter you will see the process running jupyter.
```
check-jupyter
```
You should get an output that shows your localhost and your port number separated by a :. The token is a long string of numbers and characters that will be used to authenticate your browser and will serve sort of like a password
```
http://localhost:199##/?token=3c116039b63162941f286cf8a626047018d500514d80714
```
Now open another terminal. This can be done by using the navigation bar (Shell > New Window > New Window with Profile - Basic) or by using the hotkey (command ⌘ + N).

[PuTTY: a free SSH and Telnet client](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/)

```
ssh student14@sphere.grid.bcm.edu
```
and enter the password when prompted.
